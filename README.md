## How to install a package from a Git URL (import GitHub projects into your Unity project)
The Package Manager can load a package from a Git repository on a remote server.

 with the Unity Package Manager, see the documentation on using Git URLs in your project manifest
.

To load a package from a Git URL:
<br />1.Open the add menu in the Package Managerâ€™s toolbar.

2.The options for adding packages appear.

4.Enter a valid Git URL in the text box and click Add. For more information about how to construct a valid Git URL, see Git URLs and extended syntax. Unity supports several Git protocols and some custom or extended syntax.

If Unity was able to install the package successfully, the package now appears in the package list with the  tag.
